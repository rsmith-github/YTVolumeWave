# YTVolumeWave
YTVolumeWave is a Chrome extension that modifies the volume control of YouTube videos to create a soothing up-and-down effect, which can be used in conjunction with white noise videos to create a relaxing ambiance.

# Installation
As the extension is not yet on the Chrome Extensions Store, manual installation is required.

To install the extension, follow these steps:

Go to the YTVolumeWave repository on GitHub.
Click the "Code" button and select "Download ZIP" to download the code.
Extract the ZIP file to a folder on your computer.
Open Google Chrome and go to the Extensions page (chrome://extensions/).
Enable "Developer mode" by toggling the switch in the top-right corner of the page.
Click the "Load unpacked" button and select the folder where you extracted the ZIP file.
The YTVolumeWave extension should now be installed and ready to use.

# Usage
To use the extension, simply play a video on YouTube and press the new infinity icon on your YouTube dashboard to enjoy the wave effect.
To terminate, close the tab.
